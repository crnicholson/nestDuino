nestDuino is an Arduino kit designed to be soldered and assembled. This will hopefully teach the youth at New England Sci-Tech (NEST) more about electronics in the process of learning embedded engineering with Arduino. The kit is meant to be low cost and a drop-in replacement for the Arduino Uno, keeping all the same functionality, but with all through hole components, besides the AMS1117, for ease of assembly.
